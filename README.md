4.	Brief Summary
I learned how to navigate the Jenkins dashboard and set up a basic pipeline job using the Pipeline script. I observed how Jenkins executes each stage like Build, Test, and Deploy, and how results are displayed in real time. The Stage View and Console Output helped me understand the job flow and troubleshoot. I also practiced modifying the pipeline by adding a new stage.
